This is the template repository for the docs being used by the JS-Boilerplate-Generator.
In this repository all templates are located that the download-functionality of the JS-Boilerplate-Generator requires.

## css-templates

We provide four different css-templates that a user of the Boilerplate-Generator can choose from.
A classy-template with an unobtrusive design of elegant typography and colors that has quite a reputable look for a onepager.
The happy-colors template that is a lot more fancy with playful fonts and transition-effects as well as a shiny color palette that just puts you in a good mood.
Griddy is a simple grid-template based on gridicoulos, using rows and columns to create a flexible responsive layout for any purpose.
At least dark-theme provides quite the look you might be used to from your good ol' editors that take care of your eyes when coding. 

## html-docs

Here are the templates located according to the css-files mentioned above. They include spacers for the Boilerplate-Generator to paste your selected values automatically into them.

## images

## js-file

## module-templates

contains three templates for a standard-module, presenter-module or a prototype. they all provide the spaceholders that will be enriched with users values when using the Boilerplate-Generator.
